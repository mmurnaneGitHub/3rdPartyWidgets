Measure,2.4,5/5/2017,https://geonet.esri.com/docs/DOC-3209 ,"At WAB 2.14 if you move the vertices too much the dimensions get messy as the various labels will overlap. Demo (WAB 2.4) where Polyline & Polygon work: https://gis.yakimawa.gov/measure/  TO SUSIE ROGERS: Also, the Measure tool can currently record bearings for Lines, Polylines, and Polygons if the ‘Show Bearing’ option is checked.  However, there is a recent bug where the graphic needs to be selected, resized to create a vertex, and then the new vertex needs to be deleted to correct the bearing text.   Awkward I know, but a workaround until it is fixed next year. "
